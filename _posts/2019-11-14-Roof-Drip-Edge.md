Here's a quick diversion from tech just to get this info online because I couldn't find it when I was re-roofing a porch two years ago.  This comes from good ol' Tom Silva on a recent episode of [Ask This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/testing-drip-edge-installations-roofing) in which he says to space the lower lip of drip edge a finger's width away from the roof's edge.  Then space the shingle's edge 3/8" - 1/2" over the drip-edge.  In fact, in trying to link to the *Ask This Old House* site I've found that the video is online, along with the text transcription stating as much so hopefully my linking to it will give it a little boost in Google's rankings.  Also, yes, run the drip edge on the side of a 'shed' roof and make sure that descending edge laps over the edge at the base/ eve....
