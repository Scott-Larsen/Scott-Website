title: Exit Python REPL (on Mac) with Control-D
---

Quick tip that I just learned (from a [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com) video) is that you can exit the Python REPL in Mac's Terminal by pressing `Control` and `D` instead of having to type `exit()` and hit `enter`, which is a bit clumsier.  `Control` and `C` halts any process that might be taking a while so I'm hoping it'll be easy to remember `Control` + `D` for exiting the REPL.
