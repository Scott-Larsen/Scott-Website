title: Removing Hidden Blog Post Links from Next Previous
---

I have a few posts on my (Jekyll) blog that aren't related to tech that I have hidden from the main blog page (although they're available by search or direct URL). There are several blog posts showing you how to accomplish that functionality so I won't get into it.
