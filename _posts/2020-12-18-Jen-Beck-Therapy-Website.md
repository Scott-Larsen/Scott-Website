title: Jen Beck Therapy Website
---

My sister just went out on her own as a therapist in Eugene, Oregon and so I had to get a website setup for her - [JenBeckLMFT.com](http://www.JenBeckLMFT.com).  I hadn't used any of the Python-based Static Site Generators (this site uses Jekyll) so I first downloaded Pelican but it seemed too blog-focused so I gave Nikola a shot but, even that seemed too fussy for a < 5-page 'brochure' website.  So I broke out the old HTML and CSS and just hard-coded it myself.  It was nice to be able to post to Github Pages via Git instead of having to find an old-school FTP client.
