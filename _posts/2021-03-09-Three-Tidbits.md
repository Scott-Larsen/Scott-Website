Twitter can be a huge timesuck and is generally a negative place but I stick around for gems like these.

Something I tweeted a few months back after finding it online is that if you press `command -> shift -> v` in a Markdown file in VSCode (on a Mac) you'll open up a preview window that you can then drag to the right to open as a side-by-side preview of your Markdown edits while you're making them.

And just for good measure, since I google for this at least once a month, here's the command to delete a file that you pushed to GitHub before realizing it was just clutter and added it to your `.gitignore` file (`foo.txt` is the filename to remove). Thanks to [CodeBlocQ](https://www.codeblocq.com/2016/01/Untrack-files-already-added-to-git-repository-based-on-gitignore/), my most frequent destination after googling.

git rm --cached foo.txt```
