title: from\: Can't read \/var\/mail\/tweetutilities
---

Just had a complete brain fart and am hoping I can save someone else from suffering the same. I'm following an O-Reilly tutorial about using the Twitter API and I'm running a simple `from tweetutilities import print_tweet` in the terminal. But the output - `from: can't read /var/mail/tweetutilities` is making absolutely no sense to me. Googling doesn't turn anything meaningful up. I've never dealt with `/var/mail` before and while someone else wrote the `tweetutilities.py` file, neither a search in VSCode nor my own perusing of the file showed anything that would've called `/var/mail`.

It wasn't until I took a break and came back and realized that I wasn't in the python REPL, where the command was supposed to be typed. So try....

`python3`
... and then....
`from tweetutilities import print_tweet`
