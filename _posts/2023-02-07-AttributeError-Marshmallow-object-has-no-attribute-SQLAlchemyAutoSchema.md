title: AttributeError Marshmallow object has no attribute SQLAlchemyAutoSchema
---

I was working on the really good (and free!) [Real Python](https://realpython.com) tutorial [Python REST APIs With Flask, Connexion, and SQLAlchemy](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api-part-2/) and came across the following error.

```AttributeError: 'Marshmallow' object has no attribute 'SQLAlchemyAutoSchema'```
