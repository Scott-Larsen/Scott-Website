Hi 👋, I'm Scott, a 🐍 Python Developer with HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of Javascript experience looking for my first developer role. I'm vaccinated and happy to relocate. I have experience in building websites with Flask, scraping data using Beautiful Soup and Selenium and querying REST/ GraphQL APIs. Because of my background in photography I have dabbled in and would love to delve deeper into learning from and manipulating images and video with OpenCV and computer vision.
