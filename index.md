I’m Scott, a junior Python developer, currently located in Los Angeles and looking for my first role. While it would be great to find something local (Pasadena, downtown Los Angeles, Glendale, San Gabriel Valley, San Fernando Valley, Culver City), I’m also willing to relocate for the right opportunity and would be particularly tempted by PDX, SFO, NYC, PHL, EUG, SAN, SEA or just about anywhere internationally. I have worked in multiple domains in Python and am particularly interested in computer vision and projects using OpenCV to manipulate and learn from images and videos.
